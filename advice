so React has its own server and handles the UI
ex: the login page view where you type in
the username and password

Flasks takes in that data/information, checks
if its correct and sends it back to React

Flask hold predefined data
ex: { "users": [ ... ] }

React: frontend : ui/visible components: webpage
Flask: backend : holds predefined data/checks validation: database
Flask-SQLAlchemy: backend extension : simplifies database interaction/ORM functionality: database management
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

Flask-SQLAlchemy can retrieve, store, update, and delete data,
as well as create and manage database tables using Python objects and
allows you to interact with a database using Python objects instead of writing SQL queries.
